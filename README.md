A plugin for the Serverless framework to create a version alias
for the Lambda function which is named after the current git
SHA.

This makes it easier to deduce the version that is running.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin has only been tested with the AWS provider and will
> not work if you are deploying to other providers e.g. GCP.

## Installation

Install using NPM by using the following command

```sh
npm install --save-dev @mridang/serverless-shortsha-plugin
```

And then add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - @mridang/serverless-shortsha-plugin
```

A thorough guide on installing plugins can be found at
https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs-guides-plugins

## Usage

There isn't anything specific to be done once the plugin is installed.
When you trigger a deployment, the plugin will take the short SHA
of the current directory (assuming that the project is in fact a
a Git repository).

```
$ sls deploy

Warning: Package patterns at function level are only applicable if package.individually is set to true at service level or function level in serverless.yaml. The framework will ignore the patterns defined at the function level and apply only the service-wide ones.
